Ah, you join me on an off day. You see, at the end of every day, I am thrust back into the Shadow Realm to let the spirits out. The next morning, a number of spirits will inhabit my body and bring me to back to the human world. And, well...

"I activate Red-Eyes Fusion to combine Dark Magician and the Red-Eyes Black Dragon from my Deck" ...I'm currently feeding my obsession...

"Wait, you're gonna WHAT?!" My opponent screams as a Fusion sigil materializes at my feet -

AAAH! That means I can finally say the thing! I always wanted to say this! "I call upon the warlock of Darkness, the living inferno of unyielding rage!"

"Oh, no! Not him!" Yes, cower in fear as my ultimate monster invades your realm!

"I SUMMON THEE! COME, RED-EYES DARK DRAGOON!"

Yep. The monster you love to fight with, but hate to fight against. Only two things could stop him: cards that don't specifically him, and cards that affect the entire field. And let me stop you right there; my physical Deck contains neither of those cards.

"Because I Fusion Summoned, your Continuous Spell's effect automatically triggers! I'll discard-"

"I activate High Speed Aria!"

But his does! Crud, what do I-oh, yeah.

"I'll discard Herald of the-"

"I'll see your Spell-Trap and raise you a Counter Trap! Seven Tools of the Bandit now targets High Speed Aria!"

"Oh, no! I can't-"

"You're gonna have to!"

"AAAGH! SOLEMN JUDGEMENT!"

Nut-bunnies. Thought I had it. Now, my Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon becomes Pink-Eyes Bland Drunkard...

And as you just saw, Solemn Judgement (aka, "NO" the card) costs half your LP to use, and right now he doesn't have a lot of them,

"Urgh! Ughhh..." (LP 350)

"I told you you shouldn't have wasted that Solemn Strike..." (LP 1500)

"Shut up, ok? I got desperate!"

"Your Underworld Goddess of the Closed World doesn't look too happy about it either."

"You know how much of a bully your dragoon is?!"

Well, I can't get around his Goddess, and that spell cost me the rest of my hand, so... "I end my turn."

"Huh?! That's it?!"

"That's it. And because I ended my turn, my Dragoon gets his abilities back."

"Fine! I draw!"

"Reckless Greed!"

"Huh?!"

"You know what that means. You know what my Dragoon can do, and what happens when he does it. How are you going to control that? Think carefully, now."

I don't always Duel, but when I do, it's always a captivating experience for me. How so? Well, one, I use a different Deck generated by the spirits that inhabit me on a given moment (Heart of the Cards, only literally). Two, every single one of my opponent's first turns is either Set monster and two backrow, or a mini-Solitaire game for five monsters that can be wiped with Raigeki.

And three, I don't always win. In fact, I'm currently on a 3-game losing streak. But, to be honest, that's not my priority; just playing card games is enough for me. And in this game, my opponent is in a pickle. My Dragoon can nuke 1 effect anytime during his turn, gaining 1000 ATK. And since he was summoned after the Goddess was Link Summoned, he's good to go. My opponent has used up his back row, and he's got three cards in his hand, and a Goddess that looks like she's getting impatient. I'm hoping he can force me to waste Dragoon's effect to stop one play, then immediately follow up with another play. But knowing him, he's probably just gonna-

"Underworld Goddess, attack his Dark Dragoon!"

-do that. "Quick play Contagion of Madness! Now, you'll take damage equal to half the battle damage I just took!"

"What?! But... that means..." (LP 100)

"Uh-huh. You are now within striking range of my combo attacks. And as you already know, many of my combos ping for 100." (LP 1000)

"Oh, no... uh... Fine! I'll set two cards, then end my turn."

"Good. My turn," I say with false bravado because I did not get my ping cards. So, yeah. Four shame...

"Wait, you're not gonna draw?"

"Nope. Reckless Greed skips my next two Draw Phases."

"Oh. So, then, what are you gonna do?"

"This. Entering Standby Phase, I'll use my final face-down, Call of the Haunted!"

"Did you forget? My Underworld Goddess negates revival cards! Cancel his Call of the Haunted!"

That's it. Her negate is now on cool down, "Remember when I asked you how you're gonna control Dragoon's effect?" I whip out my "cheat card", "Monster Reborn! Dark Magician returns to battle!"

"So? It's not like you have anything to topple my Goddess!"

"How does a Thousand Knives sound?"

"Wait, what now?!" He says in disbelief as her Goddess is destroyed by a thousand pointy things.

I should be concerned for his two face-downs, but... meh, "The open field beckons, Dark Magician! Direct attack now!" Just as I'm about to deal the final blow-

"Hold it! I activate Necro Fusion and Staunch Defender! I banish Chaos Beast and Garura, Wings of Resonant Life to Fusion Summon Saint Azamina!"

Well, everything I just said went down the-whoa, why's the ground shaking? And cracking?! Immediately, thorned vines and carnivorous plants start to take form and try to ensnare me, so I sprout my wings and dodge as many as I can. But then, a blood red shroud blankets the entire field, "Holy-whoa! Dark Magician, where are you?!"

He was staring at the biggest twisted monstrosity we've ever seen. A woman popped out of a fly-trap creature in a shower of purple and red, and let out a scream heard round the metroplex.

"Holy..." We were just standing there, beckoned by the woman in the center of the maw, "What is that thing..."

"THIS IS SAINT AZAMINA!"

"AZAMINA?!" I stumble while roots and flowers surround us, and with the Defender, Dark Magician is forced to attack-

"Yep! That's her name! And don't wear it out!"

...um... pardon me while I use Saint Azamina's effect to hide my ecstasy...

...YOU SAW NOTHING.

(CONDUIT - LP: 0)

Five minutes later, I'm watching another duelist go up against an army of Dark World giants. Turn one: four monsters, and the lowest ATK on the field is 2500. The catch? She's got one card in her Deck left. Oh, lawdy lawdy! One field wipe is all it takes! But does the other guy have it?

"Hey, it's you!" Hey, it's that guy I dueled!

"Hey, what's going on, man?" Fist bump.

"What're you doing here? I thought you'd be at the pavilion!"

"Nah, I'm just here to enjoy the action. I don't care about the pagentries very much."

"What you seeing-OH! SO MANY BIG MONSTERS!"

"Uh-huh. The Dark World's a very fiery place. You pay a huge cost, but it's all worth it."

"But he's got no hand now! And she's got six cards in her hand!"

"That's just it. One card can open the door to infinite possibilities. Let's see if he can find the right one." Well, he did. Pot of Avarice. Top 10 on the Deck banish face down, then draw 2. Thins the Deck so you're more likely to draw what you need in a pinch, but there's always a chance that what he needs when into banishment.

At this point, we're all holding our breath. We're waiting to see what miracle card will come out of his Deck. He closes his eyes and takes 10 cards out of the game. Then, he draws 2.

Then, he makes the most ballsy play I've ever seen. He attempts to summon a Traptrix, but it is instantly negated with Dark World Punishment, which causes a chain reaction to bring out a third Grapha... and a Clorless. And discarded his only remaining hand. Oh boy... that means instant defeat.

Or it would... if that only card wasn't Dueling Mirrors.

"Oh! OH!" And the crowd goes wild! "IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?!"

Ok, so there's no way this is a card you'd know about, so allow me to explain why this card is insane. Dueling Mirrors a normal Spell that can be activated either from your hand, or from the GY provided your field is empty and it's never been used before being sent to the GY. If activated from the hand, you can choose an opponent's monster and create a token of the same level, Attribute, Type, LV, ATK, and DEF. If activated from the GY, it creates a token for each monster your opponent has at the time of activation. You have no idea how powerful that is. Yes, their normal tokens, but... COME ON! COPY THEIR ATK! AND THIS CARD'S ACTIVATION CAN'T BE NEGATED! HELLO?!

But there's three drawbacks. One: whatever tokens remain during the End Phase are destroyed, and you take damage equal to their combined ATK... but you can Special Summon only one monster from your GY with ATK equal to or less than the damage you just took. Two: this card can only be activated once per Duel, and only during Main Phase 1. Three: you're locked out of Summoning during the turn this card is activated.

So, yeah. Quite the risk for quite the reward. It's worth it if you can find a way to turn the tables, or make a last stand. In this case, he chose to make a last stand, and populate all five of his Main Monster Zones and one Extra Zone.

"Oh! Oh! OH! IT'S A BATTLE OF THE DARK WORLD GIANTS! WHOSE SIDE WILL REIGN SUPREEEEEEEEEME!"

AGH-HEY-MY NECK!

Still, quite the spectacle. Clorless swinging down on the copy token's body while the copy's six arms stab at Clorless! Grapha swinging a tree at token Grapha, who effortlessly counters with a Megaton Kick! Reign-Beauxs wreaking major havoc on the field with their Dark Flashes! It was a Dark World kaiju cagematch. We didn't know who was on who's side, and we didn't care! We were here for the RASSLIN', and we weren't disappointed.

By battle's end, what you expected to happen happened. Every single monster slugged each other so badly, that no one was able to recover. They were all destroyed!

"AAAHAHAHAHAAA! THAT WAS THE BEST FIGHT EVER!"

Ow...

"What could be the final play?! How's he going to make a comeback from this?!"

Sadly, he's not. Good on him to bait the counter trap, but with no hand and three in the GY, he has to end his turn. Which means this is the draw that will determine the course of the Duel. We were all on our toes this time. We wanted to see how she could bring the odds back in her favor. She drew a card...

...and it was a second Dark World Ascension. A second Clorless. Game over.

By day's end, we all gathered at the pavilion (I had to fly the kid over because we were late) for the ending ceremonies. Yes, I have time for tournaments, and yes, I got goose egg this time. But where else can you say you've seen giants clash, or stared into the literal mouth of Hell, or summoned the most powerful mythical creatures known to humankind?

And the kid I Dueled? He went undefeated for the entire run, so he got the grand prize. His parents hugged him tightly. All the other participants had their loved ones comfort them/celebrate with them. This is the shit I thrive from.

So, how could I not talk with him before I go? "Looks like you're all set."

"Yeah, I didn't think I had it in me to even come here!"

"What did I tell you about believing in yourself, huh?"

"Yeah, I know. I know."

Just then, his parents came up to me. First, the mother, "I can't thank you enough for everything you've done for him."

Then, the father, "I couldn't be more prouder of him. You broke him out of his shell."

"Aw, shucks. I'm just doing my job," I say. A few more minutes of thanks and goodbyes, and I'm all alone. In the giant park, at the spot where I witnessed a Galactic Link Summon. So many good things happened today, I can't stop smiling. I know I'm taking the feeling home with me...

...because the spirits inside are taking that feeling home with them, too. My time is up, so I vanish back to my spot in the Shadow Realm. The spirits that have gathered inside my body now disperse back into the Shadows, and my body "shuts down" for a while. In this state of limbo, I'm literally a doll who cannot move or speak without something to bring me to life. All I can do is listen to the constant cries of despair and wails of regret.

If that sounds cringey in any sense... Shadow Realm, remember? Extreme depression is the new "How do you do".

"They looked so happy..."

And speaking of listening...

"We led him to victory..."

"I wish my daughter could see this..."

"Why did I betray my son?!"

"I'd give anything to feel like this again!"

"PLEASE FORGIVE ME! I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU!"

"I DON'T WANT TO KILL ANYMORE!"

Yep. These screams have been around for... I'm guessing, eternity? And I figured out that I was born from these screams. Yeah, when I said those thoughts became me, I meant that literally.

I forgot where I heard it from, but I was told that Shadow Realm has hosted some of the most heinous games and denizens of various eras. The most prominent was when Pharaoh Atem was supposed to relive his memories, until Zorc entered the scene and completely messed with the timeline in a Shadow Game that threatened the world. Since then, the Games have mostly stopped, but the souls that are trapped here have nowhere to go. They're stuck here. At first, a new soul would appear every few days; it's always a young or middle aged soul, meaning they weren't supposed to die yet. Their greatest fears and regrets are always amplified and played nonstop, to the point where they beg for some sort of release that never comes.

How do I know all of this? Well, I don't. But that is what's been happening ever since I was born, so I think that's how it's always been.

However, it seems as though souls have stopped being sent here. A good thing for those on the outside, but that also means the souls on the inside haven't been able to leave for... ever. What must it be like to be trapped in the dark for all eternity?

"MOMMY! I'M SCARED! HELP MEEEEEE~"

"MY BABY! I SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT YOU! WHERE ARE YOU?!"

The screams are always loud, but every so often they would grow extra extra extra loud, which means it's almost time for me to leave. The screams from certain souls can grow so loud that my body accepts them into my being. It allows those countless souls to inhabit my body for a limited time, and when I feel like I have enough souls in me to fuel my journey back to the world of the living...

...I'm back. This is also normal for me. Every time I leave the Shadow Realm, I always appear in a different place.

*FWOOSH!*

The actual red hell?!

*CRCKL*FWOOSH*BLAM*

Uh, am I still in the Shadow Realm?!

*BOOM!*

Story time is paused! What am I even doing here?! Ok, so I'm in an enclosed space... burning everywhere-

"WAAAAAHAHAAAAA! MOMMYYYY!"

...ok, then. Double Summon call Flame Manipulator Tribute for Mobius the Frost Monarch Monster Reborn Flame Manipulator- "You two search south, I'll search north! No casualties! Now, go!"

No time to waste! Have to find that child! I'm running everywhere, dodging collapsing structures, but I can't find anybody! Dammit, my Utility Deck isn't made for this! Wings aren't going to help in these enclosed spaces... maybe I can... Set 1, then Draw-

"Mommy... *COUGH*COUGH*... where are you..." *THUD*

She's close! Just behind this... easily collapsible wall... wings. "HAAAAA-" *CRASH!* Right when I crash through, I see the girl. I wrap my arms and wings around her to protect her from any injury- *BAM!* "UGH!" -and take the full brunt of the recoil, "Ugh... Luster Dragon... Harpie's Feather Storm..." A gust of feathers burst open a hole in the wall behind me-oh, good. The outside. Luster Dragon takes the girl to safety, but I can't leave yet. Gotta see if anyone else is here...

*WAAAAAAA*WAAAAAAA*

Whoever left a baby here must be a special kind of retarded, "Psychic Kappa!" A walking turtle appeared before me and generated a water shield... that's quickly fading! Hold on! I'm flying to you-

*SNAP*THUD* "AAAAAAGH!"

Yep, that happened... A pillar was about to fall on the baby... I made it fall on me instead...

The Kappa created a water slide for the baby to safely move down to the frantic crowd below, while I go back in and-

*CRK*CRMBL* WHOOOOAAAAA- "ARCHFIEND'S SHIELD-" *BAM!* "OOGH!"

Five floors down never hurt or burned so bad... There's a lady here, and a room that will-

*CRMMMMMM*

We're in the basement GO FAST: Use Psychic Kappa for Link Spider Fly to the woman call Change Slime and Aqua Madoor-

*CRCKL*FWOOSH*CRASH!*

I GOT A SHIELD!

*BOOM!*

"LINK THE CIRCUIT! HURRY!"

*THUD*

"UGH~"

...is it over?...

...yeah, I don't hear any cracking. It's over. Thank goodness my wings can harden, eh?

...lady? Hello?... Oh no. She's dead... She's been dead before I arrived...

*CRKKKKKKKK*WHOO...*

"Huh?" Gaia Saber. He came out just in time, "Oh, good... I can..." Oh no... I'm going down...

...nnn... huh?... feels like I'm on the grass... again with the grass?...

"Are you awake, son?"

"Uhn... yeah... I think I'm whole..."

"Well, whatever you did, you saved a whole lot of families."

"I did-huh?"

I went on many rescue missions before, but none were as suddenly overwhelming and overwhelmingly sudden as this. Screw this noise. I gotta find Gaia!

"Hey, get back here!"

I find Gaia and Flame Manipulator with the local fire brigade, "Hey, Gaia. Did we lose anyone?" I see it's helmet light up with a ton of symbols and flashing lights, eventually coming up with the number 1. That 1 being the woman whose remains I helped 'preserve'.

"No! Mother! MOTHERRRRRR!"

"Why?! Why did this have to happen?! AAAAAAAGH!"

"MOMMYYYYYY!"

Sadly, this is normal for me, too. Somehow, no matter how many my monsters and I save, there's always a few stragglers. As tragic as this is, we're lucky that the fire only claimed one victim; this could've been infinitely worse. "Ok, guys. We're not needed anymore." All my monsters disappear, and I'm off in the sky, flying to who-knows-where. And it's here in this time of solo contemplation where those voices dominate my head:

"HOW COULD WE LET HER DIE?!"

"I DIDN'T MEAN FOR THIS TO HAPPEN!"

"HOW AM I GONNA MAKE THIS RIGHT?!"

"I CAN'T! I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!"

Too bad. You're stuck with me, now. And based on what I'm hearing, we're headed somewhere none of us wants to go.

I've heard news of a vicious gang that terrorizes local villages in their country into acting as their scapegoats and doing their bidding. I've flown across the ocean to try and meet their leader, because they've always been able to stay one step ahead of the law. Is it because they know it more than the police do, or because they're that good at bringing people under their control? Either way, I'd like to see what makes them tick. Oh, look, a fountain! A perfect landing spot, if I can do it quickly without-

"Hey, who's there?!"

Oh, screw you... Set 1 card... and land on top of the fountain.

"Who do you think you are, invading our territory?!" They're swarming me with all manner of guns and other shooty-things.

"Heh, I think you're a bunch of bullies who need toys to prove their not totally worthless." I say while holding children's trading cards SHUT UP!

"That's it! No one disses us and gets away with it!"

Don't.

"Kill him!"

No.

*BABABABAPWINGPWANG*

"UGH-..."

...an entire squad done in by Mirror Force. In a Duel, this card bounces an opponent's monster's attack right back at every single opposing monster still in Attack Mode. In a fight, however...

"...you... you'll pay for... this..." *THUD!*

...same thing... if "Destroy" was "Kill".

I close my eyes and just walk. I brush past the abandoned streets, and follow the narrow corridors created by the endless maze of buildings. I can hear the murmurs of a people being oppressed, as well as the growls of the many who beat their victims into submission. For some reason, my heart skips a beat every time a scream penetrates the air. But I close my eyes to focus on my objective. This might seem... cold, but the spirits guide me in a certain direction, and I follow their lead; that often means not lending a hand to those in front of me. There's only the directive I have been given, and this time, it's for one person only. I ignore the horrors happening around me to find their leader. Sure enough, I feel myself stopping, and open my eyes.

Well, that's a very big... building. Big enough to rival the White House. Oh, and they even got a security detail.

"Hey, who are you?!" One of them screams, alerting others to my location.

But I'm not too worried. This is what my Utility Deck is made for, "I want an audience with the ruler of the palace."

"Are you some kind of idiot?!" A guy laughed, "No one gets in without approval and a tribute!"

"What do I need to give him-hm?" Suddenly, a gun at my neck.

"A thousand USD. Right now." He growls.

"No, don't bother. Look at him! He doesn't have anything! Just a stupid arm blade toy!"

"What good will that do?!"

"You know what? You're dead."

Oh, boy, we're doing this now. The instant he pulls the trigger, my DuelDisk is already at the barrel.

*BANG!* "AAAGH!"

The bullet easily bounced off my Disk and into another guard. Here we go!

"GET HIM-OOF!" I elbow my Disk in his gut, and punch it in another guy's face. I grab a gun and start shooting wildly to ward them off, then I play Hinotama and Ookazi. 1300 damage in a Duel, but in a fight-

*BOOM*BOOM*BOOM*FWOOOOOOOOOOOO*

-a massive fire. Alarms start going off. More men screaming and panicking. Then...

"HOW COULD YOU IDIOTS ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN?! BRING HIM UNDER CONTROL NOW!"

...that's the guy I'm looking for. I fly in the sky, play Lightning Blade, and close my eyes.

Come on, then. Let me hear you scream.

"THERE! SHOOT HIM!"

GOTCHA! RUSH RECKLESSLY! *WHOOSH* *BOOM!*

"Uhh... uhhhh..."

Before anyone could blink, I have my DuelDisk right at my target's throat. He's quivering in fear, no doubt from the pure shock of seeing someone exhibit unmatched destructive power in a literal instant. The rubble I blasted off the walls literally scared everyone else away. I open my eyes and show them to him, making my target lose all feeling, and bringing him down on his knees. He's a crime lord, so this could be an act.

I better make it clear, "I'm here for your hostages." The Lightning Blade pops out of my Field Spell slot, nearly slicing the man's head off. But the small cut it left behind is more than enough for him to get the message, "Bring them out. Unharmed."

A few minutes later, and the hostages are brought to me. They've already been battered, and someone hit them right before they arrived. The hostages looked scared, but I use my Interdimensional Matter Transporter to transport them back to their places of residence.

"Now, what?" My target demands, "You've left me with no leverage. But my men are ready for you. What will you do now?"

I smirk, "Remember when I said that I was here for your hostages?"

"What about?"

An evil grin stretches across my face as I throw down a Raigeki, "I lied."

Right then and there, a rainstorm of lightning showered upon the land, destroying every single structure and killing every single person it contacted.

The man wails in despair at how easily everything he built up is destroyed, "NO! YOU MONSTER! HOW COULD YOU?!"

"Takes one to know one, am I right?!"

He tries to shoot me as I fly away, but he missed every single shot! How do you do that?! I can see him desperately trying to do anything he can to hit me once, but eventually a lightning bolt takes him. The Raigeki storm stops, and boy. Did it stop at the right time... Every single thing that stood on its own was reduced to ash. Miraculously, only the members of gangs were killed; literally everyone else was spared, but they had to pick up the pieces. Well, too bad for them, 'cuz I did what I came here to do. And because of that, I'm gonna keel... o... ver...

...

...back here again...

...just in time for the souls to start screaming again.

"WE GOT THERE TOO LATE! WE LET THEM KILL THEM!"

"WHAT MORE DO I HAVE TO DO?!"

"SOMEONE SAVE ME! HELP ME NOT BE ME!"

"WHY DID I LET THEM TAKE MY SON?! WHYYYYYY?!"

"MOTHER! FATHER! PLEASE, FORGIVE ME!"

And just like always, the memories gained from the experiences in the real world devolve back into regretting the choices that got them sent to the Shadow Realm. But an interesting question pops into mind:

Can anything be done to help them?
